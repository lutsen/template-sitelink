Lagan Properties Site Link Template
===================================

Admin template to create a link from the admin web-interface to the corresponding website page.

**This template is rather stupid right now, in the sense that it assumes your links always look like app_url.'/'.bean->type.'/'.bean->slug, and the bean model always has a slug which is called slug (all of which they probably not always do).**

To be used with [Lagan](https://github.com/lutsen/lagan). Lagan lets you create flexible content objects with a simple class, and manage them with a web interface.

Lagan is a project of [LÃºtsen Stellingwerff](http://lutsen.land/) from [HoverKraft](http://www.hoverkraft.nl/).
